Ultimate-CMS
============

Ultimate Content Management System

## Intro
UCMS will be based upon some best practises and best scripts/frameworks available.
The credits for all codes and scripts goes to the their owners/publishers.
UCMS is just the glue between them. Nothing more, nothing less.
UCMS will be a continous improvement project and will take some time before a usable version will be ready to publish

## basic idea

HTML5 Boilerplate
Blueprint CSS framework
Swiftmailer mail class
famfamfam silky icon-set
jQuery
jQueryUI + all jQueryUI widgets
A bunch of commonly used javascripts
a bunch of css layouts and templates.

## MySQL Database:

Despite PDO exists, UCMS is focussed on MySQL only,
so UCMS can fully be optimized for use with MySQL and the php mysqli library.
This narrows the use of UCMS, but it  can fully take all advantages of the MySQL database,
in favor of a broader use of more databases.
If you prefer an other database, choose another CMS or you are encouraged to start your own UCMS-based project!
Remember: UCMS is open source and you are allowed to change everything you want 
and to publish your changes the way you want. 
But do read the licences of included scripts/classes and keep in complinance with that licenses!
